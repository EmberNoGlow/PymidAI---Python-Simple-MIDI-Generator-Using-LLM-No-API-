## What is it?

**PymidAI** is a collection of simple **Python scripts** designed for generating MIDI files. It works by taking arrays of notes generated by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT, Grok, Deepseek, Gemini, and others. Importantly, **PymidAI does not require a direct API** for interaction with LLMs.

## 🔥 How it Works

PymidAI is built for simplicity and accessibility. Follow these steps to create your own MIDI melodies:

1.  **Get Note Arrays from an LLM:**
    Use the example prompts provided in the `Examples AI Requests` folder, or create your own, to generate sequences of notes. The LLM should output data in an array format similar to this:

    ```python
    [
        # Intro - tremolo motif
        (64, 0.125), (64, 0.125), (67, 0.25), (71, 0.5),  # E-G-B
        (63, 0.333), (66, 0.333), (70, 0.333),  # D#-F#-A triplet

        # A Section - ascending sequence
        (64, 0.25), (65, 0.25), (67, 0.25), (69, 0.25),  # E-F-G-A
        (72, 0.75), (71, 0.125), (69, 0.125),  # High B with grace notes

        # Chromatic bridge
        (76, 0.5), (75, 0.25), (74, 0.25),  # E-F♯-G
        (73, 0.25), (72, 0.25), (71, 0.25), (70, 0.25),  # Semi-tonal descent
        
        # ... continued for 160 beats (for example) ...
    ]
    ```
    Each tuple `(pitch, duration)` represents a note:
    *   `pitch`: The MIDI note number (e.g., 64 for E4, 67 for G4).
    *   `duration`: The duration of the note in beats (e.g., 0.25 for a quarter note, 0.5 for a half note).

2.  **Paste the Array into the Script:**
    *   For a single melody: Copy your generated array into the `mid_gen.py` file in the `melody` variable.
    *   For dual hands (treble/bass): Copy your respective arrays into `dual_hands_mid_gen.py` into the `treble` and `bass` variables.

3.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the Python script from your command line:
    ```bash
    python mid_gen.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python dual_hands_mid_gen.py
    ```
    Upon completion, the script will generate a MIDI file in the current directory.

4.  **Open Your MIDI File:**
    You can open the created MIDI file in any Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as `Reaper`, `FL Studio`, `Ableton Live`, or use music learning software like `Synthesia`. Example MIDI files are available in the `ExampleMidi` folder.

## 📚 Data Structure Parameters:
**Notes_array**: List of events where each event is:
```
        (pitch, duration)         -> Single note
        ([p1, p2, ...], duration) -> Chord
        (None, duration)          -> Rest
```
        


## 🚀 Features

*   **Easy to Use:** Quickly create short, simple melodies.
*   **Uses `midiutil`:** A robust library for MIDI file creation.
*   **Clear Code:** The code is very simple and ideal for learning MIDI manipulation in Python.
*   **Flexibility:** You can generate single-hand or dual-hand melodies using different scripts.

## 👊 Limitations

*   **Quality Depends on LLM Prompts:** The output is directly dependent on the quality of your prompts to the LLM. It's highly recommended to study the example prompts in the `Examples AI Requests` folder.
*   **No Direct API:** PymidAI does not integrate directly with LLMs. You will need to generate your note arrays independently using web interfaces or other available tools.
